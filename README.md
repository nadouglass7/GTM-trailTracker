# GTM-trailTracker
Various web maps and sites to track trail mapping progress.

Ideas and evolution:
1. Map page centered around map project with trails completed/trails needed still
2. Map Dashboard for each project with stats for trails completed/trails needed still
3. Map page with all working map projects
